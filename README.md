- 👋 Hi, I’m @BlackhandHermes
- 👀 I’m interested in Python and Javascript
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Javascript and my work has been outside of that realm for the most part.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that can be transferred to Real World Application
- 📫 How to reach me send me a message!
- ⚡ Fun fact: I have been programming for many years! I am also not a fan of web development, But much more into IOT. We also can lockpick, and physical Penetration testing is in my wheelhouse.
